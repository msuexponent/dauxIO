<h4>Analytics</h4>

Jetpack is a WordPress plugin which adds powerful features previously only available to WordPress.com users including customization, traffic, mobile, content, and performance tools. Included in the plugin is a section called “Site Stats” which provides a bar graph display of the hits to the website. The statistics for the last two weeks are shown in the administration dashboard, along with the top posts and most recent searches. For advanced statistics, the “Google Analytics by Yoast” plugin is enabled and is ready to configure. A Google Analytics ID can be claimed from the Exponent’s account on Google Analytics.
