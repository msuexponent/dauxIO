## SSH keys

An SSH key is required to access the files on the server. The first step is to create the key pair on the client machine (usually your computer):

	```
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	```

Once you have entered the SSH key generator command, you will get a few more questions:

Enter file in which to save the key (/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
You can press enter here, saving the file to the user home (in this case, my example user is called demo).

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
You can choose whether or not to enter a passphrase here. 

Enter the following command and replace the bold text with the serverâ€™s IP address. This will copy the SSH key you just created to the server and prompt you for the root password:

	```
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@[your.ip.address.here] "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
	```

You can now test your connection to the server using SSH:

	```
	ssh root@[your.ip.address.here]
	```
