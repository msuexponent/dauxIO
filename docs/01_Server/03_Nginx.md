<h4>Nginx</h4>

Nginx is one of the most popular web servers in the world and is responsible for hosting some of the largest and highest-traffic sites on the internet. It is more resource-friendly than Apache in most cases and can be used as a web server or a reverse proxy. There is no additional setup required here. In case there is a need to restart the server, run the following command as root:

<p class="code">service nginx restart</p>
